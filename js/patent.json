A block comprising a plurality of packets to be transmitted over a network is received. The block includes a set of batches, and the plurality of packets are distributed between the set of batches. A pseudo interleaver depth is calculated for each of the set of batches to produce a set of pseudo interleaver depths. Blockwise adaptive recoding is performed using the set of pseudo interleaver depths to produce a number of recoded packets for each of the set of batches. A transmission sequence is generated using the number of recoded packets for each of the set of batches."

In operation of a multi-phase recoding technique a first node in a multi-hop wireless network data communication path between a source node and a destination node provides recoding and transmission of packets of a BNC batch to a second node in the communication path via multiple phases.  Multi-phase recoding makes use of the reception status of the recoded packets that have been received by the second node in earlier phases of multi-phase recoding operation with respect to transmission of a particular batch.  Multi-phase recoding feedback from the second node to the first node may be provided so that the first node can determine how many recoded packets are to be sent in the next phase of multi-phase recoding operation."

Systematic recoding at intermediate network nodes may be utilized to reduce the computational cost during recoding. A block interleaver based BATS protocol may be utilized to handle burst loss, where batches are recoded to a same number of packets. Adaptive recoding may be utilized to improve the throughput, where a batch with a higher rank is recoded to a larger number of packets. Using adaptive recoding, a non-block interleaver based BATS protocol may be utilized."
